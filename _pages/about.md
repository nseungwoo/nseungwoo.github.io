I am a PhD student at [Optical Engineering and Quantam Electronics Lab](http://oeqelab.snu.ac.kr/), Seoul National Univeristy. 
I was formerly supervised by the late Prof. [Byoungho Lee](http://oeqelab.snu.ac.kr/PROF) and currently supervised by Prof. [Yoonchan Jeong](https://laser.snu.ac.kr/members/professor). 
Prior to this, I received my BS degree in [Electrical and Computer Engineering from Seoul National University](http://ee.snu.ac.kr/en).

My research area includes holography, AR/VR, computational displays, and visual perception.
